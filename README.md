# ML-practice-projects
Several ML practice projects using logistic regression and/or neural networks models

Two projects use data from an E-commerce website about the user behavior to predict user action. One project uses logistic regression to predict a binary outcome.
The other E-commerce project uses logistic regression model and then neural networks model to predict a multiclass outcome (softmax).

The other two projects use facial expression recognition dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains 48 x 48 pxls greyscale images of people faces 
labeled with 6 possible emotions. The projects build a logistic regression and neural networks models to predict the emotion from the image.
